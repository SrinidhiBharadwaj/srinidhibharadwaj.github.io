I am a graduate student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department of University of California San Diego. My major is Intelligent Systems, Robotics and Control. I am a student researcher at the Contextual Robotics Institute's [Autonomous Vehicle Laboratory](http://avl.ucsd.edu) working on road network estimation and dynamic scene modeling for autonmous navigation in urban environments.

I obtained my undergraduate degree in Electronics and Telecommunication engineering during which I worked with [Prof. Niranjana Krupa](https://staff.pes.edu/nm1042) on SSVEP based Brain Computer Interface for Game Control.

Before starting my master's, I worked at Analog Device Inc, Bangalore as a Senior Software Engineer in the Infotainment, Processing and Connectivity team. Our team was responsible for desigining and developing software framework for next generation automotive bus architecture, [Automotive Audio Bus](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/software/a2b-software.html#software-overview). I was also involved with developing A<sup>2</sup>B plugins for Analog Devices' audio networking tool - [SigmaStudio](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/software/ss_sigst_02.html). I am fortunate to have been mentored my some of the brightest minds at ADI - [Jagannath Rotti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jagannath-rotti-a380416/), [Prasanna Thirumaleshwara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prasanna-b-t-899a9491/), [Karthik Radhakrishna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karthik-radhakrishna-02918627/), [Suhasini Raghuram](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suhasinipr/).
