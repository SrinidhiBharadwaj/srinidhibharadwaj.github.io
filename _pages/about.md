I am a graduate student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering depart of University of California San Diego. My major is Intelligent Systems, Robotics and Control. I am a student researcher at the Contextual Robotics Institute's [Autonomous Vehicle Laboratory](http://avl.ucsd.edu) working on road network estimation and dynamic scene modeling for autonmous navigation in urban environments.

I obtained my undergraduate degree in Electronics and Telecommunication engineering during which I worked with [Prof. Niranjana Krupa](https://staff.pes.edu/nm1042) on SSVEP based Brain Computer Interface for Game Control.


## Research Interests
- Scene modeling for autonmous vehicles
- Intersection of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence
- Edge AI
