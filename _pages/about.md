I am currently a researcher at Autodesk Research's Robotics Lab building adaptive robotics assembly systems for manufacturing and construction applications. My main focus and research interst is the intersection of AI and Robotics. 

Previously, I graduated from UC San Diego with where I majored in Intelligent Systems, Robotics and Control. At UC San Diego, I was a graduate student researcher at Contextual Robotics Institute's [Autonomous Vehicle Laboratory](http://avl.ucsd.edu) working on road network estimation and dynamic scene modeling for autonmous navigation in urban environment under the supervsion of [Prof. Henrik I. Christensen](http://www.hichristensen.net/).

I worked at Analog Device Inc, Bangalore as a Senior Software Engineer in the Infotainment, Processing and Connectivity team from 2018 to 2021. Our team was responsible for desigining and developing platform agnostic software framework for next generation automotive bus architecture, [Automotive Audio Bus](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/software/a2b-software.html#software-overview).  I was also involved with developing A<sup>2</sup>B plugins for Analog Devices' audio networking tool - [SigmaStudio](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/software/ss_sigst_02.html). 
<!-- I am fortunate to have been mentored my some of the brightest minds at ADI - [Jagannath Rotti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jagannath-rotti-a380416/), [Prasanna Thirumaleshwara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prasanna-b-t-899a9491/), [Karthik Radhakrishna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karthik-radhakrishna-02918627/), [Suhasini Raghuram](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suhasinipr/).
