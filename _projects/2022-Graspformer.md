[Code](https://github.com/SrinidhiBharadwaj/GraspFormer), [Report](https://github.com/SrinidhiBharadwaj/GraspFormer/blob/main/Collaterals/Report.pdf)

Implemented a Detection Transformer (DETR) based Neural Network with Resnet backbone for detecting grasps for an object
of interest. We used Bipartite Matching Loss to train the model and the evaluated model performance with vanilla cross entropy loss.
