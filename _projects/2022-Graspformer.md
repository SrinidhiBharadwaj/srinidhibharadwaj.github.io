[Code](https://github.com/SrinidhiBharadwaj/GraspFormer), [Report](https://github.com/SrinidhiBharadwaj/GraspFormer/blob/main/Collaterals/Report.pdf)

- Implemented a Detection Transformer (DETR) based Neural Network with Resnet backbone for detecting grasps for an object
of interest
- Used Bipartite Matching Loss to train the model and the evaluated model performance with vanilla cross entropy loss
